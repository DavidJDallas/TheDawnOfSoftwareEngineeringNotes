# Introduction

Sets out the overall picture of the book. The key idea is to reframe the orthodox view in the history of computing/software that Turing's work was directly responsible for certain key ideas in Software Engineering. Specifically, three ideas:
(1) That Turing's work has played a central role in the advent of the first universal computer.
(2) That Church's lambda calculus is at the heart of a clear road from logic/theory to practice that starts with the lambda calculus and ends with programming languages of the more functional flavour. Specifically with McCarthy's LISP. E.g. Trakhtenbrot, who claims that McCarthy started out with pure LISP and added non-lambda features for computational efficiency. 
(3) That the Church-Turing thesis is the birth of theoretical computer science. 

Further, the orthodox history that is presented favours theory over practice, and thus favours logicians and mathematicians over engineers. The latter are neglecgted from this history, and Daylight is seeking to bring them back into the picture. 

Regarding (2), he points to the fact that McCarthy clearly and explicitly rejects this. He started with imperative programming, and only gradually worked towards a functional programming idea. 

Davis also claims similar claims regarding programming languages. 

Daylight argues that in decades when interpreters were being built, leading computer programmers did not initially view Turing's universal machine as an interpretative programme in any practical sense. 

Regarding (3), It's inaccurrate - Daylight claims - in several respects:
(i) Turing was a mathematciain and not a logician. [This seems trivial to me].
(ii) It was mainly Church, not Turing.
(iii) Also due to the work of Godel and others, e.g. Herbrand, that the definition of a recursive functionwas introduced. 

It was also not Turing who introduced what we now call a 'Turing machine'.

The book aims to reframe this narrative in favour of Dijkstra's influence. 



The structure of the book is as follows:
Chapter 2: Ellaborates on some claims made in the previous paragraph. 
Chapter 3: Investiages how the mathematical aesthetics of the Amsterdamers, Dijkstra and van Mijngaarden, led to the advent of the recursive procedure in imperative programming in the 1960s. 
Chapters 4 -7 are interviews with other programmers through history.
